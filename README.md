# SISRIS
A public repository of materials for the SISRIS project, "Supporting inclusive and sustainable research infrastructure for systematics (SISRIS) by connecting scientists and their specimens" (NSF #2247631, #2247632).

## Pre-Workshop Activities (estimated time for completion: 60 min)

- [ ] Skim open-access paper [Groom et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baaa072) for an overview of why disambiguating the names of collectors and identifiers of biological specimens is important for advancing scientific research and for increasing professional recognition of taxonomic expertise.
- [ ] Watch first 31 minutes of a [You-Tube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL_feKhrwMQ) from a prior Bionomia workshop about bat specimens, as a case study explaining concepts and terminology in biodiversity informatics and Bionomia that relate to "people-data". This will allow you to hit the ground running in the upcoming workshop.
- [ ] Set your ORCID profile to "Public".
- [ ] Sign up as a user on [Bionomia](https://bionomia.net/) using your ORCID ID number.
- [ ] Bring your laptop to the workshop.
