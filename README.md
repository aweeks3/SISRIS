# What is SISRIS?
<img align="left" width="200" height="200" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19411979/222419960-80c9dabc-5021-4c2a-aadf-7a5ca2c04a5f.jpg">

The project, "Supporting inclusive and sustainable research infrastructure for systematics (SISRIS) by connecting scientists and their specimens" is supported by a [conference grant from the US National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2247631&HistoricalAwards=false) to Dr. Andrea Weeks (George Mason University; Ted R. Bradley Herbarium), and Drs. Shawn Zeringue-Krosnick and Twanelle Majors (Tennessee Tech University; Hollister Herbarium). It supports two US-based workshops and symposia at the 2023 annual meetings of the [Association of Southeastern Biologists](https://www.sebiologists.org/asb-2023.html) and [Botany 2023](https://2023.botanyconference.org/). The purpose of the work is to share new practices that improve attribution of natural history specimens and highlight research advances in systematics that can be made as a consequence of improved people-data within biodiversity informatics databases.

# How can I participate in SISRIS?

Workshop participation at either of the conferences is by application to this site: [SISRIS WORKSHOP REGISTRATION](https://tntech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bKrV3uJMACTDIkS). Workshop participants must also be registered conference participants in order to attend the events.

**Participation stipends are available from the NSF award to defray the cost of attending the workshop.**  For ASB, these include 19 stipends @ $325 and 6 stipends @ $650, the latter designated to support individuals from groups underrepresented in science. For Botany, these include 22 stipends @ $500 and 8 stipends @ $1000. Limited funds should also be available to defray the cost of family dependent-care, if requested. All stipends are dispersed after workshop events. 

Symposium attendance is open to any and all registered conference participants. Confirmed invited speakers and their titles are posted below. Inquiries about SISRIS may be directed to SISRIS2023[at]gmail[dot]com.

## Pre-Workshop Homework (estimated time for completion: 60 min)
1. Skim open-access paper [Groom et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baaa072) for an overview of why disambiguating the names of collectors and identifiers of biological specimens is important for advancing scientific research and for increasing professional recognition of taxonomic expertise.
2. Watch first 31 minutes of a [You-Tube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL_feKhrwMQ) from a prior Bionomia workshop about bat specimens, as a case study explaining concepts and terminology in biodiversity informatics and Bionomia that relate to "people-data". This will allow you to hit the ground running in the upcoming workshop.
3. Set your ORCID profile to "Public".
4. Sign up as a user on [Bionomia](https://bionomia.net/) using your ORCID ID number.
5. Bring your laptop to the workshop.
6. Bring your questions.

## Workshop Materials
1. Link to Our Data Set in an [editable Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18g8jUAF1KLwavRz1DRTeGxjS-kWokJB5ScT7KqfxKko/edit?usp=sharing) containing some names of historical botanical collectors in the US who have digitized specimen data posted to GBIF and who are available on Bionomia for disambiguation during the workshop. Note: this list is not exhaustive.
2. [PDF of how-to directions](https://github.com/aweeks3/SISRIS/blob/main/documents/bionomia-for-sisris-v0-24March2023.pdf) that reiterate workshop workflow (e.g. historical attribution, claiming one's specimens, reporting institutional metrics, importing unique collector ID's back into your institution's DB).
