# What is SISRIS?
The project, "Supporting inclusive and sustainable research infrastructure for systematics (SISRIS) by connecting scientists and their specimens" is a conference grant supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF #2247631 (Andrea Weeks, George Mason Univerity), #2247632 (Shawn Zeringue-Krosnick and Twanelle Majors, Tennesee Tech University). It supports two workshops and symposia at the annual meeting of the Association of Southeastern Biologists (March 2023; Winston-Salem, North Carolina) and Botany 2023 (July 2023; Boise, Idaho). The purpose of the work is to share new practices that improve attribution of natural history specimens and highlight research advances in systematics that can be made as consequence of improved "people-data" within biodiversity informatics databases.

# Workshops

## Pre-Workshop Activities (estimated time for completion: 60 min)

- [ ] Skim open-access paper [Groom et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baaa072) for an overview of why disambiguating the names of collectors and identifiers of biological specimens is important for advancing scientific research and for increasing professional recognition of taxonomic expertise.
- [ ] Watch first 31 minutes of a [You-Tube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL_feKhrwMQ) from a prior Bionomia workshop about bat specimens, as a case study explaining concepts and terminology in biodiversity informatics and Bionomia that relate to "people-data". This will allow you to hit the ground running in the upcoming workshop.
- [ ] Set your ORCID profile to "Public".
- [ ] Sign up as a user on [Bionomia](https://bionomia.net/) using your ORCID ID number.
- [ ] Bring your laptop to the workshop.

## Workshop Schedule
* 8:00–8:10 am: Welcome and logistics
* 8:10–8:30 am: Introductory remarks
* 8:30–9:45 am: Hands-on: Participants disambiguate names of collectors from underrepresented groups on the
Bionomia platform.
* 9:45–10:15 am: Break
* 10:15–11:35 am: Hands-on: Participants document their own expertise and research contributions to
biological research collections using Bionomia, learn how to use additional tools to augment their curriculum
vitae and future publications, and learn how to track collection-level research impact.
* 11:35–11:40 am: Concluding remarks about how to amplify this effort after the workshop.
* 11:40 am–12:00 pm: Hands-on: Participants complete online workshop survey that will be emailed to each person.
* 12:00 pm: Adjourn

## Workshop Materials
1. Link to editable Google Sheet containing some names of historical botanical collectors in the US from underrepresented groups who have digitized specimens posted to GBIF & Bionomia, elibible for disambiguation during the workshop. Note: this list is not exhaustive.
2. PDF of how-to directions that reiterate workshop workflow [historical attribution, claiming ones specimens, reporting institutional metrics, importing unique collector ID's back into your institutions DB].
